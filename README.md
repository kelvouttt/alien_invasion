# Alien Invasion

A mini-project of mine to create a game using Python 'Pygame' as a training module for myself to gain more experience in using Python OOP. This course is guided by Python Crash Course by Eric Matthes. 

## Purpose of this project

I am making this project to study more about the concept of object-oriented programming separating class into different modules. There are some functions that I found similar to Unity while I was studying it using C#. I still have problems finishing the game as it freezes and become unplayable since I implemented some movements to the game. 

## Knowledge used in this project
* venv
* Git
* pip 
* Pygame
